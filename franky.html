  <font color="white"size="4">
    , born Cutty Flam, is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates — a cyborg with a heart as bold as his blue hair. He’s loud, wild, and unapologetically SUPER! Built like steel and powered by cola, Franky is the genius who crafted the Thousand Sunny, a ship worthy of the Pirate King’s crew.

    Once a reckless dismantler from Water 7, Franky turned his pain and passion into invention. He rebuilt himself from scrap metal after tragedy, proving that a man doesn’t need to be born strong — he can build his own strength. Beneath the sunglasses and swagger is a loyal soul who values family, freedom, and the dream of crossing the seas with his nakama.

    Franky isn’t just iron on the outside — he’s iron-willed within. Whether he’s blasting cannons, surfing explosions, or striking a ridiculous pose, Franky reminds everyone that true strength comes from embracing who you are, loudly and proudly.
