  <font color="white" size="4">
    is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates — a blue-nosed reindeer who ate the <b>Human-Human Fruit</b>, giving him the ability to transform into both human and hybrid forms. Don’t let his cute looks fool you — Chopper is a medical genius and a fierce fighter when needed. With his <b>Rumble Balls</b>, he can alter his transformations and unleash incredible power, shifting between forms like Heavy Point and Monster Point. Innocent, kind-hearted, and endlessly curious, Chopper dreams of becoming a doctor who can cure any disease in the world. Though he’s shy and often mistaken for the crew’s pet, he’s one of their most dependable and courageous members — a true hero with the heart of both a man and a reindeer.
