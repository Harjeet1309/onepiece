    is the swordsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the main fighters of the crew. Known for his incredible strength, unwavering determination, and loyalty, Zoro dreams of becoming the world’s greatest swordsman. He is famous for his Three-Sword Style (Santoryu), wielding a sword in each hand and one in his mouth, allowing him to perform devastating attacks. Zoro’s intense training and fearlessness in battle make him a formidable ally and a terrifying opponent. Despite his often stoic and serious demeanor, he deeply values his captain, Monkey D. Luffy, and his crewmates, following them with absolute dedication on their journey through the Grand Line.
