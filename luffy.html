    is the main protagonist of One Piece and the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates. Born in the East Blue, Luffy possesses a cheerful, fearless, and determined personality, always ready to protect his friends and fight for his dreams. He ate the <b>Gomu Gomu no Mi</b> (Gum-Gum Fruit), a Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, granting him extraordinary stretching abilities but taking away his ability to swim. Luffy’s ultimate goal is to become the <b>Pirate King</b> by finding the legendary treasure known as One Piece. Known for his unwavering will, adventurous spirit, and deep loyalty to his crew, Luffy inspires both his friends and countless fans around the world.
